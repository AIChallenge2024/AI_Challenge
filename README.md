# AI_Challenge
## Product Description 

We developed a Web Application, where users can click anywhere (countries, cities, etc.) on the map, and it shows all tourist attractions, and other interesting places. Users also get to report hidden places (places not discovered yet/ advertised a lot about), and it pops up on the map for all the other users to see. This way people do not have to worry about searching for places to go to, our application already shows it!
